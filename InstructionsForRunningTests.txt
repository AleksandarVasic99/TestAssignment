The Test1 was done with Selenium using JUnit
When you run the test as JUnit,In console there will be text saying "Input name of the browser:".You can type in chrome or edge.
The Task2 was done in selenium using JUnit and RestAssured.
Due to lack of knowledge and experience when it comes to JUnit and RestAssured i wasnt able to fully automate the test.
To run the test,token needs to be inputed manualy,and after that the second part of the test will need the url to be changed,becouse i didnt find a way to get the id of the user that the first part creates.This also goes for the 3 part of the test.
I spend a nice amount of time tryng to automate it as much as i cant but the get method didnt pull the user that i created.
